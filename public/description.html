        <p>
            I Jovan Hristovski who is the invetor of this website, I always wondered<br>
            where people can go and be informed about the new technologies in the world.<br>
            I searched and didnt find many places, so i went and built one! This is a first<br>
            of its kind Website, which has many things for the users to do. From learning all kinds<br>
            of new stuff about the upcoming technologies, to debating on all kinds of topics.<br>
            It's free to use for everyone, but you also can buy the premium version which gives you <br>
            many advanteages. Like commenting, grading, and also you get to talk and make new friends!<br>

        <p>
            Our goal with this website is to inform as many people as possible for the upcoming<br>
            technology. And to educate the public of the positive and negative sides of technology.<br>
            Through different games, seminars, activities and other projects.<br>
            We think that is very importent for people to know where we are with our progress<br>
            and to help with the developing of the future world.
